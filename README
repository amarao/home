This is ansible project to configure my home machine.
It's under heavy construction and I don't really care about reusability beyound my
own needs.

Although, you may find here few things interesting.

Index:
* base.yaml - configure mirros, sudo, umask for all users
* dist-upgrade.yaml - performs dist upgrade
* nvidia.yaml - install nvidia
* wifi.yaml - configure and install drivers for my RT2560 usb card and configure wifi connection
* software.yaml - installs different collection of software I use
* atom.yaml - install fresh version of Atom editor
* stream.yaml - create user for steam (work in progress, there are a lot to do here)
* pam.yaml - configure my own encryption scheme for my encrypted home directory.
